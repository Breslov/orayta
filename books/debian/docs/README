Books for Orayta.

If the books were downloaded separately, you should run in their folder:
$ sh GenMakeFile.sh
and then (as root):
# make install

if this doesn't work you should copy all the books manually to the directory:
/usr/share/Orayta/Books
the following command should do it:
# cp -r -f ./ /usr/share/Orayta/
